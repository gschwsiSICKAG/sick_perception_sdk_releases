When asked to install the SDK you need to execute the following steps:

1. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/install" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install_sdk" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
2. `cmake --build build --target install -j`

When asked to build the examples add `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` to the cmake configuration command.

A dynamic build can be created by adding `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to the cmake configuration command.

When asked to build an example you need to execute the following steps:

1. `cd examples/picoScan100`
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/../../install;$PWD/../../install_sdk" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
3. `cmake --build build -j --config Release`

On Windows, remove `$PWD/` to avoid issues with path formats.

For running cmake you need to activate .venv if this folder exists.
